<p>
  I was born in New York City, New York, on June 8, 2004. I was taken home to a wonderful house in New Rochelle, New York and have lived there for all of my life. When I got old enough, I attended Daniel Webster Magnet School which wasn't too far from my home. During my expedition through elementary school, I learned everything from science to Spanish. I made good friends and played numerous sports and instruments. I played soccer, golf, swam, played basketball, played the piano, the clarinet, and the piano. When my time came I departed from Daniel Webster and started my next journey through middle school. I attended Albert Leonard Middle School which is a few miles further than Webster. There I learned much more about biology, algebra, language, and that's when I realized I loved to play video games. When I first played video games it was a pastime for my close family and friends. As I got older I discovered the potential in video games to make a living. Popular streamers and game designers were becoming extremely wealthy off something they liked to play and make. I thought to myself and decided this is what I wanted to do in life, so I brought this idea to my parents. I tried to explain to them the business of streaming but they only understood the production side of video games. They said I could pursue streaming after I learned the basics of coding and video game production. So here I am today learning anything and everything I can about coding. I hope to one day create my own game company and make popular games everyone will know worldwide.
