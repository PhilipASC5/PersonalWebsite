                <li> I was born in New York City, New York, on June 8, 2004 </li>
                    <li>I was taken home to a wonderful house in New Rochelle, New York and have lived there all of my life.</li>
                <li>
                    when I got old enough I attended Daniel Webster Magnet School which wasn't too far from my home.
                </li>
            <li>
               During my expedition through elementary school I learned everything from science to spanish. I made good friends and played numerous sports. I played soccer, I swam, and I played basketball.   </li>
            <li>When my time came I departed from Daniel Webster and started my next journey through middle school. I attended Albert Leonard Middle School which is a few miles further than Webster. There I learned much more about biology, algebra, language, and that's when I realized I loved to play video games.  </li> <li>
                When I first played video games it was a past-time for my close family and friends. As I got older I discovered the potential in video games to make a living. Popular streamers and game designers were becoming extremely wealthy off something they liked to play and make. I thought to myself and decided this is what I wanted to do in life, so I brought this idea to my parents. I tried to explain to them the business of streaming but they only understood the production side of video games. They said I could pursue streaming after I learned the basics of coding and video game production. So here I am today learning anything and everything I can about coding. I hope to one day create my own game company and make popular games everyone will know worldwide.
